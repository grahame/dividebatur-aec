Australian Senate Election, 2013.  1370 ballots were lost in this

of what the missing ballots were, assuming that they were counted 
correctly in the first count, and that none of the informal votes 
from the first count would have become formal on re-examination.

is derived from the AEC data, but the changes made are not official.
